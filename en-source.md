# Event source
{: #en-source}

A service or application on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} that emits event notifications and publishes them to a topic within the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. A source is a registered entity in an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance. Several services on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} are set to be integrated to send notifications to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}.
IBM Monitoring and {{site.data.keyword.compliance_long}} are enabled while {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full_notm}} is being enabled shortly. A source can publish to multiple topics. In other context, sources are identified as producers or publishers.
